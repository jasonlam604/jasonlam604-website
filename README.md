# Jasonlam604 Personal Website

This just my personal website, no real use for anyone else.  Perhaps, just to look at some Elixir & Phoenix code for a simple static site.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jasonlam604/jasonlam604-website.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jasonlam604/jasonlam604-website)

To start my website:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
